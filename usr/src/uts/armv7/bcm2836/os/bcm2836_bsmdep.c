	 * we don't have one.
	 *
	 * This can be toggled on the rPi, but it appears that that toggling
	 * can't be probed for.
	 *
	 * At present, we set these variables as if we owned the l2,
	 * regardless of whether we in fact do.  This might be a terrible
	 * idea.
	 *
	 * XXX: It might be reasonable to demand that we (the CPU) have the l2
	 * cache, although since it is off-chip this may actually hinder
	 * performance.
