# This drives the generation of all of the different platform modules that are
# based on armv6. Generally each different board or SOC will end up as its own
# platform and thus with its own unix. For those who have only ever really lived
# in i86pc with its psm modules, yes, this is a bit different. This Makefile
# itself is totally broken, but it's here to just give us a bit of something to
# start with. Yay, team.
