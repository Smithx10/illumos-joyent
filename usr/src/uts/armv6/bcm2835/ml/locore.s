 * We are in a primordial world here. The BMC2835 is going to come along and
 * boot us at _start. Normally we would go ahead and use a main() function, but
 * for now, we'll do that ourselves. As we've started the world, we also need to
 * set up a few things about us, for example our stack pointer. To help us out,
 * it's useful to remember the rough memory map. Remember, this is for physcial
 * addresses. There is no virtual memory here. These sizes are often manipulated
 * by the 'configuration' in the bootloader.

 * With the Raspberry Pi Model B, we have 512 MB of SDRAM. That means we have a
 * range of addresses from [0, 0x20000000). If we assume that the minimum amount
 * of DRAM is given to the GPU - 32 MB, that means we really have the following
 * range: [0, 0x1e000000).
 *
 * By default, this binary will be loaded into 0x8000. For now, that means we
 * will set our initial stack to 0x10000000.
